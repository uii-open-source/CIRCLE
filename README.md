## The CIRCLE-ZS2K Dataset
We randomly selected 2,000 cases from our internal validation set for open release, including both images and their corresponding reports (CIRCLE-ZS2K dataset), which can be publicly accessed via [Hugging Face repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wangxiaoyuwangdayu/CIRCLE).
